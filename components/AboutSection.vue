      <p class="text-lg mb-4">
        Communali is more than just an app—it's a way to connect with your neighborhood, discover hidden treasures, and contribute to a sustainable future. Whether you're looking for affordable second-hand items, want to give away things you no longer need, or simply connect with others in your community, Communali brings people together in meaningful ways.

      <h3 class="text-3xl font-semibold mb-4">The Person Behind</h3>
      <p class="text-lg mb-4">
        I'm Noga, the woman behind Communali. I’m a soon-to-be graduate with a top-up degree in web development from Esbjerg Erhvervsakademi, and I also hold an AP degree in multimedia design. For more than 10 years, I’ve dreamed of creating a platform that blends sustainability with community engagement—a platform that not only helps people save money but also strengthens the bonds between neighbors.
      </p>
      <p class="text-lg mb-4">
        As part of my internship, I'm bringing this idea to life. Communali is the realization of a vision I’ve nurtured for over a decade: a map-based platform for second-hand shopping, designed to be fun, intuitive, and centered around you, the user. Whether you’re a student living on a budget, a young professional, or someone who values sustainability and community, Communali is here to help you find great deals or even help others by giving away what you no longer need.
      </p>
      <p class="text-lg mb-6">
        At Communali, we believe that second-hand shopping can be more than just a transaction—it can be a positive experience that brings joy, builds community, and promotes sustainability. I'm excited to share this journey with you, and I can't wait for you to experience the magic of Communali.
      </p>

      <h3 class="text-3xl font-semibold mb-4">Our Mission</h3>

      <h3 class="text-3xl font-semibold mb-4">Who Is Kommunali For?</h3>
      <p class="text-lg">
        Our primary audience is young adults aged 18-26, many of whom are students living on a budget, possibly relocating, and highly value sustainability.
