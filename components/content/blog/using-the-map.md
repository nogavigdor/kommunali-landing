One of Communali's most exciting features is the **interactive map**, where each house in your neighborhood becomes a mini-shop. You can browse what your neighbors are giving away or selling, and find treasures just a few steps away from your door.

Hereâ€™s how to get the most out of this feature:

### How It Works
- **Markers**: Every house with items for sale or giveaway will have a marker. Clicking on the marker will show you what's available.
- **Categories**: Filter your searches by categories like clothes, electronics, furniture, and more. This helps you find exactly what you're looking for in your neighborhood.
- **Giveaways**: Some markers will feature items listed as *free* giveaways, encouraging a circular economy and reducing waste.

Using the map is an effortless way to engage with your community and support a more sustainable lifestyle.
