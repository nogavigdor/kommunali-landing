At Kommunali, we’ve made it simple to find second-hand treasures right in your neighborhood. Our app is all about connecting people locally, making it easy for you to explore items your neighbors no longer need—whether they're selling or giving them away for free.

## What Is Kommunali?

Kommunali isn’t your typical second-hand marketplace. It’s built on the idea that proximity and personal interaction make second-hand exchanges smoother and more trustworthy. You can open your own store on an interactive community map, where other users can browse your items, send requests, and meet you face-to-face for a direct exchange.

Instead of dealing with shipping, long waits, or the uncertainty of online transactions, you get to interact with people nearby, in real life. It’s more personal, and let’s face it—it’s just easier when the person you’re buying from or giving to is a short walk away.

## Why Kommunali?

- **Local and Simple:** Browse a map of your community, click on nearby stores, and see what’s available. If you like something, send a request and arrange to meet up. No shipping headaches, just straightforward, local deals.
- **Trust and Community:** We all feel better buying or trading with people we know—or at least people we can meet in person. Kommunali strengthens local connections by helping you exchange items with people in your area. This isn’t just about finding a good deal, it’s about building trust and relationships with those around you.

- **Eco-Friendly by Design:** Second-hand shopping isn’t just about saving money—it’s about sustainability. Reusing items helps reduce waste and contributes to a healthier planet. Kommunali makes it easy to be part of this movement by keeping it local and accessible.

## How It Works

1. **Create Your Store:** Open a personal store on the map. List the items you’re ready to part with, whether you’re selling or giving them away for free.

2. **Browse and Explore:** Check out the map to see what others are offering. Each store icon represents a local user with items up for grabs. Hover over the icons to get a quick view of what’s available.

3. **Meet and Exchange:** Found something you want? Send a request, connect directly, and arrange to meet in person. No middlemen, just real people, real items, and real exchanges.
